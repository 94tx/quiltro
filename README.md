who doesn't like reinventing the wheel over and over and over and over and...
you get the point.

this is the code that will power my new blog at some point, right now there's
only code written for some database stuff and that's it.

## interesting code
- `auth` module contains an interface to OpenBSD's authentication system.
  I will probably not use it anyways since I originally was going to use it
  to avoid a database, and I ended up using SQLite anyways. :P
